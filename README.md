# Computer Infection Detection
what does this repository contain?
```
This repo contains ML Models to detect whether or not the user computer is infected.
```
What package/platform dependencies do I need to have to run the code?
```
the netflow files where generated using openargus on kali-rolling 2020.3
The following packages need to be installed to run the code:
1. sklearn 
2. joblib 
3. xgboost
4. numpy
5. pandas
```
How do I use it?
```
1. Run a sniffer tool (we used wireshark) to generate .pcap file with out using the interent.
2. Run the commands found in : argus_files/create netflow file.txt on the generated .pcap file.
3. Run 'python main.py <metric> <file name>.netflow' command.

main.py input
  metrics- after creating amd testing the models we picked the best models of 3 categories:
      1. accuracy: we chose the model with highest test Balanced Accuracy*.
      2. recall: we chose the model with the highest test Infected Recall.
      3. precision: we chose the model with the highest test Infected Precision.
 file.netflow- the generated file after using argus command.
      
*Balanced Accuracy: the average of Infected Recall and Normal Recall. Used for unbalanced data.
